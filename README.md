# Training Demos Repository

Welcome to my Training Demos repository! ðŸŽ“

This repo contains various demo projects I've created as part of my learning journey with .NET and other related technologies. The goal is to experiment, practice, and improve my skills by building different solutions.

## Current Projects

- **Logging Console App**: A console application that demonstrates logging with Serilog and other .NET logging techniques.

## Whatâ€™s to Come?

This repository will continue to grow over time. I'll be adding more projects and solutions as I explore new concepts, libraries, and tools.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/training-demos.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.

3. Run the project (for example, the Logging Console App), and check the output.
